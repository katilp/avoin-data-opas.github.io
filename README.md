# About these pages

Github pages are deployed automatically from this repository's master branch.

This repository contains the main index page (in the master branch). The specific topic pages and their subtopic pages are in the gh-pages bracnh of other repositories of this organization (such as [Lyhyesti](https://github.com/avoin-data-opas/lyhyesti/tree/gh-pages).

The page layout is defined in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html) for the pages in Finnish and in [_layouts/default_en.html](_layouts/default_en.html) for the pages in English, and some values such as topic names are read from [_data/docs.yml](_data/docs.yml). The page layout for the pages from other repositories are defined in their respective layout and data definitions directories.    

If you want to add a new repository, copy the files of a topic repository and modify the necessary input in docs.yml.
